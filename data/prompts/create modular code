To achieve a highly modular and well-structured project like the document_store we've developed, you could use a prompt like this:

"I need to create a new Python project with a focus on modularity, separation of concerns, and best practices in software engineering. The project should be structured as follows:

1. Core functionality divided into separate modules, each with a single responsibility.
2. Clear interfaces defined for each module using abstract base classes.
3. Implementation details hidden behind these interfaces.
4. A factory pattern for creating instances of the main components.
5. Utility functions separated into their own module.
6. Configuration handling isolated from the main logic.
7. Error handling implemented throughout the system.
8. A testing structure that allows for unit tests of individual components.

The project should also follow these principles:

- Dependency Injection: Components should receive their dependencies rather than creating them.
- Open/Closed Principle: The system should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid code duplication by abstracting common functionality.
- SOLID principles should be applied throughout the design.

Please provide a detailed project structure, including:

1. A list of all necessary modules and their responsibilities.
2. The key classes and functions that should be implemented in each module.
3. How these modules will interact with each other.
4. A suggested directory structure for the project.
5. Any design patterns that should be applied.

The project should be flexible enough to allow for easy addition of new features or changing of implementation details without affecting the overall structure.

As a concrete example, one of the core functionalities should be a document store that can work with different backend storage systems (like local file storage or a database). Show how this would be implemented in the proposed structure."

This prompt:
1. Emphasizes modularity and separation of concerns.
2. Specifies key software engineering principles to follow.
3. Asks for a detailed breakdown of the project structure.
4. Requests information on how modules will interact.
5. Emphasizes flexibility and extensibility.
6. Provides a specific example (document store) to guide the design.

By using a prompt like this, you're more likely to get a comprehensive, well-structured design that follows best practices in software engineering, similar to the document_store we developed.
